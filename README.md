This interactive functional JavaScript Quiz Game allows a player to test their knoweledge of world captial cities.

The project is based on a JSON database, written by myself, that provides the users with a question, 3 incorrect answer and a correct answer as well as a corresponding flag to that country. 

The codebase uses conditional statements to check whether the user has selected the correct answer and changes the element colour to green and alerts a "correct" sound effect. The points total will increase by 1 when each correct answer is selected.

If the user has not selected the correct answer, the elements will display as red and a "wrong answer" sound effect will be alerted.
